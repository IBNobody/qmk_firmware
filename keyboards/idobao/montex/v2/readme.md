To jump to the bootloader, the default in the repository and stock on the board is to hold the 4th key on the top row and tap the first key in the top row. Alternate methods are to hold the upper-left key down when plugging in the keyboard or pressing the reset button. (The reset button is accessable from the underside of the keyboard through an access hole.)
